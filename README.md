# Occupancy of Terrestrial Mammal Species in US National Parks

Data and code for occupancy analysis of terrestrial mammal species detected with camera traps in US National Parks.

These scripts will generate single-season, single-species occupancy models of terrestrial mammal species and estimate influences of environmental covariates on occupancy and detection probabilities. The following plots and distribution maps, visualizing the occupancy models, can be created with the scripts as well.

Only code for White-tailed deer in Chiricahua National Monument is uploaded. Contact author for other species and National Parks.

#### Influence of Suvery-covariate on Detection Probability

#### Distribution Map for Species of Interest based on top Occupancy Model
