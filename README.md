# Occupancy of Terrestrial Mammals in US National Parks

Data and code for occupancy analysis of terrestrial mammal species detected with camera traps in US National Parks.

These scripts will generate single-season, single-species occupancy models of terrestrial mammal species and estimate influences of environmental covariates on occupancy and detection probabilities. The plots and distribution map, shown below, visualize the occupancy models and can be created with the scripts as well.

Only code for White-tailed deer in Chiricahua National Monument is uploaded. "Camdata_2020.R" is used for data formatting, "[NEW] CHIR_ODVI_2017_2020-05-25.R" is used for occupancy modeling and graph creation. Contact author for other species and National Parks (abuckisch@email.arizona.edu).

For a fully reproducible example download and run "ODVI_ReprEX_SODN_GitHub.R". This script uses the same dataset and will generate the same graphs and maps, but is fully reproducible on any computer.
